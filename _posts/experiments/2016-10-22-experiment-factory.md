## About

[The Experiment Factory](https://www.expfactory.org) is an online platform for reproducible, web-based experiments. The original project was started by a group of graduate students in the Poldracklab at Stanford University, <a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00610/full" target="_blank">published</a>, and is currently still deployed to serve over 80 behavioral assessments to Amazon Mechanical Turk for several studies at Stanford University, which are <a href="https://expfactory.github.io" target="_blank">available for viewing</a> along with <a href="https://expfactory.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">documentation</a> for deploying the Version 1.0 locally or on a server for your lab.

## Future

The primary developer has joined teams with a sibling open source software, <a href="https://github.com/openexp/OpenEXP" target="_blank">OpenEXP</a>, to develop the next version of Experiment Factory that will truly be available to all researchers. Version 2.0 is well under way, and experiments, surveys, and the base software can be <a href="https://www.github.com/expfactory">viewed and contributed to</a>.

Please post ideas an issues on the <a href="https://www.github.com/expfactory/issues"> Version 2.0 Repository</a>. We welcome and appreciate all contributions!
