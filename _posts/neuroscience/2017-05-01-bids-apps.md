BIDS[http://bids-apps.neuroimaging.io](http://bids-apps.neuroimaging.io) is an effort driven by the Stanford Center for reproducible neuroscience and the [Poldracklab(http://poldracklab.stanford.edu) at Stanford. BIDS containers can be put together like legos to create highly distributable, standardized processing pipelines for neuroimaging data.
