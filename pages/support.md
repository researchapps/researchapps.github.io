Have a computational or statistical problem that you need help with? Or maybe you have an account on Farmshare or Proclus, and so now what? You have a boatload of data to make sense of, but how? Wonder where you can do your research project, and who can help you? You know what you want to do – but how best to do it, you just aren’t sure. Help is here in the form of <a target="_blank" href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/su-hpc/cgi-bin/mediawiki/index.php/SMACC">SMACC – Stat, Math, Algorithmic and Computational Consulting</a>! Technical consultants from ICME, Research Computing, Statistics and IRiSS will be available to work with youin the basement of Huang (in front of ICME). One stop shopping for your scientific computing needs. Rather than poke around web sites and send mail to multiple groups, drop by to catch all of us at once. 

Details are at <a target="_blank" href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/su-hpc/cgi-bin/mediawiki/index.php/SMACC">SMACC</a>.
