## Getting Started
While the material may initially seem daunting, don't be discouraged.  If you've been able to pick up R or SAS to do any work, you'll be able to easily figure out how to use Linux.  However, you do need to dedicate a couple of hours of training time to save you time in the future. Follow our step by step guide below to become a master in no time.

### Interactive Crash Course 
<em>(45min)</em>

* http://linuxsurvival.com/

If you can pass all four short quizzes, you can move on.

### Intro Tutorial
What about linux in the context of cluster computing? The Cornell Center for Advanced Computing has a great <a href="https://cvw.cac.cornell.edu/Linux" target="_blank">Linux Tutorial</a> that we recommend to new users. This is a tutorial that is typical for any specific Linux system 
<a href="https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/documents/13601/1080823/LinuxIntro-20141009-eijkhout+%281%29.pdf/bcdcefad-47c5-4741-ab9f-c3380e63df93" target="_blank">PDF</a>.

In the section called "Editing Files", keep in mind that in addition to `vi` and `vim`, you might want to try `nano`, as many users find it easier.

### Software Carpentry
<em>(4hrs)</em>
* [shell-novice](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/ )


### Linux Manual
<em>(10hrs)</em>
Third, read through this book:
* http://www.stanford.edu/~chekh/lxes-en-manual-cc.pdf

### Lynda Training
Stanford has a contract with <a href="http://www.lynda.com" target="_blank">lynda.com</a> so all content on Lynda.com is available to us.  
Check out the course: "<a href="http://www.lynda.com/Mac-OS-X-10-6-tutorials/Unix-for-Mac-OS-X-Users/78546-2.html" target="_blank">Unix for Mac OS X Users</a>".  You can skip Chapter 9 which is Mac-specific.

This course covers the same material as the PDF book in the link above, but you get video and narration.

### Self-paced
You may want to take this free self-paced course (40hrs):
* EdX course https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-linux-linuxfoundationx-lfs101x-2

### Stanford Clusters
Next, look for a tutorial specific to one of our systems: Farmshare, sherlock, xstream, etc.


## Scientific Computing

Read the "<a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745" target="_blank">Best Practices for Scientific Computing</a>" a paper written by biologists for biologists in 2014

* In support of the basic concepts espoused above, there is [a great website](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons.html):
* A great and accessible intro to using `git` [is here](http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~blynn/gitmagic/).

## Intro to Programming
There are a lot of online resources to learn basic programming, this one is probably a good intro and uses a programming language that is currently popular (9 weeks, 15hrs/week):
